# MovieLens Recommendation System

This repository contains R code for building and evaluating a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens 10M dataset. The recommendation system is based on collaborative filtering techniques and involves the creation of training and test sets, as well as the evaluation of different models.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this code is to demonstrate the implementation of a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering on the MovieLens 10M dataset. The step-by-step process includes data processing, model development, and evaluation. The models considered include baseline, movie effect, movie and user effect, and a regularized version for improved accuracy.

## R Markdown (RMD) Report

Additionally, an R Markdown file (`MovieLens Project.Rmd`) has been included in this repository. This RMD file contains a detailed report documenting the process, methodology, and results of the recommendation system project. The report has been knitted into a PDF file (`MovieLens-Project.pdf`), providing a comprehensive overview of the project and its outcomes.

Feel free to refer to the RMD report for a more in-depth analysis and insights into the recommendation system's performance.



*Note: This project's RMD file template was inspired by a template, and AI (ChatGPT) was used to assist in commenting on the code. While AI support was utilized, the project's development is the result of individual effort and understanding.*
